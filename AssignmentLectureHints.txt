For Assignment: 

- Map texture to terrain: GL_REPEAT 
- Generating texture coordinates, use for mesh in assignment: TriangleMesh 
- Textures and shapes provided for trees - just need to position them and load them to assignment 
- glsl code:
	- Add a second light to shaders = two sets of separate lighting equations 
	- Small change to Phong Tex Vertex Shaders - copy and then make the small change 
		- Vertex shader - bilinear interpolation, foreshortening 
- Animated textures: make sure you don't load the textures every frame - load at start, swap out when needed 
- Normal Mapping: apply to interpolated normals to create illusion of bumpiness to a rough surface texture on a smooth flat surface
- Terrain: write your own code to generate the indices for the terrain. 
	- Think how to divide the terrain up into triangles
		- First thinking in terms of squares. How could you divide the terrain up into squares? 
		- Then dividing it up into triangles is just a matter of splitting each square in two.
